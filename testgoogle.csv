1,Data Engineer,OVRSEA,"Paris, France",via Lever,"About us

Our mission: to simplify international transportation through technology and data! ‚úàÔ∏è

Founded in 2017, Ovrsea is a new generation freight forwarder that uses technology to simplify and optimize international transportation for companies. We support more than 600 companies such as Engie, Vinci, Devialet, S√©zane or even Nuxe in more than 60 countries in their international freight transport.

We allow our customers to manage all their transport issues in a few clicks from our web interface, from quotation to invoicing, by digitizing the entire transport tracking experience. We have also developed an in-house platform to facilitate the operational management of our customers‚Äô transports in order to best meet their needs in record time.

Ovrsea, a fast-growing company ‚Ä¶

The year 2021 has been strategic for Ovrsea: Since January 2021, we have joined forces with the Bollor√© Group to accelerate our development and we have recruited 50 people.

2022 promises to be an even more... challenging year with the recruitment of 100+ people, the opening of 4 new international offices and thus expand on the international market! Moreover we plan to triple our revenue for the third year in a row.

Are you ready to join us and be a part of our development? üöÄ

Job Description

The Data team:

Composed of three people and in full growth in the year to come, the Data team's main objectives are to serve our various teams in order to free up their work & make them more efficient and productive, but also to work on long-term AI projects to unlock growth levers for the company.

This includes :
-Providing business teams with key data and indicators to monitor their activity and their customers‚Äô health, and automate certain tasks to allow them to focus on higher added value ones
-Building AI algorithms to take our products to the next level: price and transit time predictions, automated document parsing, scoring and attrition models, etc.

The Data team is associated with the Tech team that develops the customer platform as well as the internal transportation management platform. Through this internal platform, the Software Engineers have the chance to develop an internal product: it allows them to iterate much faster (several deployments per day), to test many things and to have some freedom of action.

What does it mean to be a Data Engineer at OVRSEA?

Being a Data Engineer at Ovrsea means being the guarantor of the Data technologies. In other words, you will be in charge of consolidating and scaling our stack, while ensuring we stick to the highest standards in terms of tools & code practice. Furthermore, you will have the unique opportunity to shape the Data Engineering activity at Ovrsea for the years to come, given an exciting context of hypergrowth (importing and exporting goods in more than 60 countries) üèóÔ∏è ‚úàÔ∏è

Here are the missions that we propose to you (non-exhaustive list):

Stack & Practice (50%)

-Improve our codebase‚Äôs structure and composition: replicability, no redundancy, observability
-Speed up computations, reduce downtime, reinforce our services‚Äô robustness: collaborating with Product & Tech will also be fundamental to anticipate any release impact on the Data
-Build tests and sanity checks frameworks in order to challenge the code and the data and serenely release our models

DevOps & Site Reliability (30%)

-DevOps perspective: reinforce our CI/CD pipelines to reduce the iteration loop and release better and faster
-Site Reliability perspective: create secure and accurate workflows to serenely provide data to external users - clients, followers

Evolution (20%)

-Keep a close eye on the state of the art: identify the most adequate practices and tools for us, and the necessary resources for any development
-Propose efficient development frameworks to test a solution & release it if satisfactory

At Ovrsea, we are committed to an inclusive recruitment process and to fostering diversity within our teams",['√Ä plein temps'],{'schedule_type': '√Ä plein temps'},eyJqb2JfdGl0bGUiOiJEYXRhIEVuZ2luZWVyIiwiaHRpZG9jaWQiOiJCdFBHZW9mb29mUUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBPT0iLCJ1dWxlIjoidytDQUlRSUNJZ1VHRnlhWE1zVUdGeWFYTXNTV3hsTFdSbExVWnlZVzVqWlN4R2NtRnVZMlUiLCJobCI6ImZyIiwiYXBwbHlfbGluayI6eyJ0aXRsZSI6IlBvc3R1bGVyIHN1ciBMZXZlciIsImxpbmsiOiJodHRwczovL2pvYnMubGV2ZXIuY28vZm9yZXNlYS10ZWNobm9sb2dpZXMvN2I2YWMxODMtMTVmYi00NDliLWI5ODMtMjI3YzA5MjJmZWYzP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1nb29nbGVfam9ic19hcHBseVx1MDAyNnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9Z29vZ2xlX2pvYnNfYXBwbHlcdTAwMjZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW9yZ2FuaWMifX0=,
2,Data Engineer,Tweag,"Paris, France",via Greenhouse,"Notice as of 1 July 2022:
The Tweag team has been joined by many amazing engineers this year. As of mid-summer, we have already met our hiring goals for the current period, so we are not currently interviewing candidates. However, you are encouraged to continue to apply as we will be resuming our hiring in Fall 2022, with the goal of onboarding new team members around December 2022.

Tweag is a software innovation lab with a global team of thoughtful and friendly engineers, working together to build better software by applying mathematics, computer science and the methods of open source.

Our high-profile community projects and contributions are driven by experience helping deep tech startup clients quickly scale their engineering performance and execute on high-risk, high-reward projects with confidence.

We are big on composable software: functional, typed, immutable. In our data engineering projects, we apply these principles to build tooling for efficient, reproducible and... maintainable systems in complex industry sectors such as biotech, retail, finance and autonomous vehicles.

We're looking for exceptional data engineers to join our team and help us move the industry forward. You would work either remotely (from almost any country), or on-site at our office in the centre of Paris. Most of our team works remotely, and has done since long before the pandemic.

Who are you?

Your skill set will grow constantly with each new client project, so consider applying if you are inquisitive, willing to fail often and adapt quickly. You should be comfortable with feeling out of your depth and rapidly becoming an expert in a new field.

An open mind towards functional programming and reproducible software systems is a bonus. Don't feel like knowledge in these areas is a prerequisite.

As an engineer at Tweag, you
‚Ä¢ identify and quickly learn new skills and techniques needed to work in new areas,
‚Ä¢ work autonomously, organising and clearly communicating your plans,
‚Ä¢ value high-quality and elegant software,
‚Ä¢ enjoy using principles from one area to help solve problems in another,
‚Ä¢ cultivate good relationships with clients and with colleagues,
‚Ä¢ can explain and discuss complex topics,
‚Ä¢ are highly competent in at least one programming language (Scala, Python, Java, C++, Haskell, Clojure, or others),
‚Ä¢ have a good understanding of developer tools and techniques such as Git, GitHub/GitLab, CI, testing, Nix and Docker.

A typical data engineering candidate has, in addition, experience with some or all of the following:
‚Ä¢ putting data workflows into production: cloud environments, databases, scheduling and workflow tools such as Apache Airflow, Nextflow, ...,
‚Ä¢ large-scale data architectures such as data warehouses, data lakes, and data lakehouses. Experience with Databricks, Snowflake, or other cloud data platforms is a plus.
‚Ä¢ event-driven systems and stream processing techniques using tools such as Apache Spark, Flink, or Beam
‚Ä¢ a decent understanding about a data scientist‚Äôs work, including machine learning and different modeling techniques.
‚Ä¢ building dashboards and data visualizations

Please note that these requirements are only a guideline. Our engineers are delightfully unique, and so are you: we believe that outstanding teams have diversity of background and thought. More than the qualifications listed on your resume, if you're excited to join a fully remote global team that's working to have a positive impact on the software engineering community then we encourage you to apply even if your experience doesn't align perfectly to what is listed above.

What will you be doing?

Engineers at Tweag primarily work in small groups embedded in a client team, collaborating with the client‚Äôs engineers and each other. In parallel, Tweag engineers connect and collaborate with each other across project boundaries, teaching, learning and improving our many research and community projects.

Benefits
‚Ä¢ The chance to work on interesting problems and work with and learn from amazing people,
‚Ä¢ a flexible work environment, based either remotely or in our Paris office,
‚Ä¢ the opportunity to work on your own innovative projects, if they align with Tweag‚Äôs goals,
